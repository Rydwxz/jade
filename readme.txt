Just Another Directory Explorer

Jade is an attempt to bring together the best features from tools like

xplr - composable configurability, layouts, & modes
broot - partially expanded recursive view
clifm - select and batch commands with line numbers
zoxide - effortless directory jumping
fzf - fuzzy picking

all in an experience so seamless you will never need to quit: in fact, the goal is to make
the user want to make it their terminal emulator's default launch program instead of the shell.
Jade wants to be a single solution for browsing the filesystem, managing files, and launching tools.
