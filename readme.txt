Just Another Directory Explorer

Jade is an attempt to bring together the best features from tools like
xplr - composable configurability, layouts, & modes
broot - partially expanded recursive view
clifm - select and batch commands with line numbers
zoxide - effortless directory jumping
fzf - fuzzy picking
all in an experience so seamless you will never need to quit: in fact, you'll want
to make it your terminal emulator's default launch program instead of your shell. Jade will
be your single solution for browsing the filesystem, managing files, and launching tools.
